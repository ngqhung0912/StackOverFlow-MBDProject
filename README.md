# StackOverFlow-MBDProject

### Main instructions: 
- Python files are located in codes/ directory, and different files answer different research questions. Since submitting 
code dependencies on Spark is not straighforward, we decided to copy-paste some of the functions between all the files - 
therefore there might be duplicates. 

- Each file will have different running instructions (for submitting to spark.) Python notebook files (.ipynb) are 
designed to run either locally or on UT's jupyter server. 

- Some figures (not all) are available on the /fig directory. Other figures will be available on their research question's
Jupyter notebook.
